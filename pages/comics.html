<br>
ladies if itâ€™s this time of the month for you remember no
inversions<br>
SAYS WHO?<br>
corpse pose<br>
the back of your body rests<br>
soften the facefront neck shoulders throat chest relaxed<br>
the air leaves your lungs<br>
a last conscious breath before<br>
releasing control<br>
allow natural flow to spread through<br>
entire nervous system<br>
vein and tissue routes<br>
increasingly thoughts fade away<br>
seem unimportant distant<br>
the body disconnects from outer senses<br>
impulses decrease tensions release<br>
brain calms down and clears<br>
you are outside of time<br>
you are in place to receive<br>
hear with new ears<br>
let go<br>
dissolve<br>
let go of it all <br>
