title: ðŸ”® The Future of the Antiuniversity
---

After many years of co-organising the Antiuniversity, the current crew is ready to hand over this wonderful, radical, wayward baby project. We will be hosting an outreach event to meet those interested in helping out and explain how the festival is currently organised.

The Antiuniversity is a constantly evolving, self-organised, radical learning festival and organising it is easy and fun!

It mostly takes a few weeks between May and Sept, the systems are ready to go and we will support any new people to do the kind of stuff they enjoy the most.

Tasks involved in co-organising the Antiuni include:

â€¢ find new + confirm existing venues (we have a good list!)<br>
â€¢ techies: self-hosting open-source festival platform, contribute to rad digital tools for a better world<br>
â€¢ help to manage our super easy to use online platform (once the techies have done their work)<br>
â€¢ some design if youâ€™re into that!<br>
â€¢ social media to promote the festival<br>
â€¢ low level event coordination & admin (replying to emails, sending booking forms, etc)<br>

We encourage anyone who would like to see the Antiuniversity festival continue to join this event!
