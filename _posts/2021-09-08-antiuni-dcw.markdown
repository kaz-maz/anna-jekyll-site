title: ✊ Organising The Cultural Sector, A Social & Workshops @Conway Hall, Antiuniversity 2021
---
*What are the particular challenges to labour organising that are faced by cultural workers?*
*Can we adapt traditional organising strategies and learn from past struggles?*
*What new tools or principles might be necessary to take on the cultural industry and win?*

Work in the cultural sector is fragmented, precarious, and poorly regulated. While certain cultural work is well unionised, huge sections of the workforce remain unrepresented and prevented from organising by employment practices that keep workers atomised and on short-term freelance contracts, promoting individualisation, competitiveness, and fear of blacklisting. Existing collective agreements cannot keep up with the constant creation of new job types and contracts, which offer little security and deny workers their basic rights. Cultural workers are overworked, burnt out and underpaid, making organising all the more challenging, yet all the more essential if we are to demand a just recovery of the sector.

On the first Wednesday of each month, the Designers + Cultural Workers branch of United Voices of the World holds an all-member meeting, giving an opportunity for all current and prospective members to find out more about how the union organises, feed ideas into campaigns, connect with other members, and share knowledge.

This month’s meeting will be **open to all** and take place during the Antiuniversity Festival, for a more social and playful event!

Together we will test run tools from newly launched [transformyour.work](https://transformyour.work/) like [~Interviewing your double](https://transformyour.work/6e2f9932a0764e8d979236bd241dc93d) or [~Cultural Artefacts](https://transformyour.work/bc9773ac4dd841aa810e8b35262a5515).
