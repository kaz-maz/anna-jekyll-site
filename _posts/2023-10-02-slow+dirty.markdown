title: ðŸ“• Collectivising feminist publishing-> Slow + Dirty Press
---

ðŸ“œ Join us in our utopian dreaming for a brainstorming session on DIY publishing and what it could look like to set up a feminist press free from submission processes, top-down editing or formatting pressures, instead founded on resource sharing, mutual support, companionship, comadreo, transmission, circulation, political alliances, multi-disciplinarity and collectivised knowledge.

ðŸŒ¾ We are interested in looking into how open-source principles have been applied to spaces other than software and tech. What open-source principles could we apply to a press? We are also interested in looking at worker-led economic models (particularly of farms + agriculture) of collectivised labour and â€˜profitâ€™. How can we all self-publish but share essential resources to continue to make together + independently?

The workshop will be facilitated by Slow + Dirty Press: Anna Corfa, AnahÃ­ Saravia Herrera + Jemima Yong. We are thinking about setting up a press that answers collective desires to publish really diverse publications whilst also sharing key skills and resources, as well as collective frustrations about how expensive everything is, curatorial gatekeeping and the general feeling that self-publishing is lonely. Collectively we are writers, designers, producers, performers, textile makers, community organisers, feminists, trade unionists, retired comms managers and more.

ðŸ“š Everyone is welcome! Weâ€™d especially love to invite those currently self-publishing and running publishing projects to help us dream together about the future.

ðŸ’¬ Weâ€™ll be talking about things like:

What is DIY publishing?<br>
What does it mean to invite everyone to a publishing house?<br>
How can we collectivise our resources - printers/ guillotines/ staples?<br>
How can we all make enough Â£Â£ to keep self-publishing? How can everyone make Â£Â£ from each otherâ€™s publications?<br>
What can we do to make DIY publishing feel less lonely? How can we attend fairs together?<br>
Thoughts on CHAOS vs. CURATION: How do we define an identity for a press without being too prescriptive and inviting chaos into the equation?<br>
Will that just make it ugly and the work poorly edited? (lol)<br>
DEmystification of DIY publishing + the arts<br>

ðŸ’“ This is a relaxed workshop, there will be snacks and non-alcoholic drinks, break areas
