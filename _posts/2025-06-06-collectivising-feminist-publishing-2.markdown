title: ðŸ“— Collectivising feminist publishing #2
---
Slow + Dirty Press is a work in progress feminist community press. We are currently hosted on the second floor of House of Annetta. Which also makes us members and facilitators of the House of Annetta Community Press.

End of 2023, we gathered in Mayday Rooms with the invitation to: *Join us in our utopian dreaming for a brainstorming session on DIY publishing and what it could look like to set up a feminist press free from submission processes, top-down editing or formatting pressures, instead founded on resource sharing, mutual support, companionship, comadreo, transmission, circulation, political alliances, multidisciplinarity and collectivised knowledge.* We looked into open source principles and examples of workers collectivising resources in agriculture, as inspiration.

Now that the pressâ€™ material conditions have evolved and is luckily more settled, we would like to invite you again, with the intention to continue building on our networks of solidarity across presses, members of the self-publishing community, campaigners, activists...

Together, we would like to practically think of systems of resource and skill sharing. Many new community presses are dotted across London and we are often dreaming of better mapping our networks. Perhaps this is a call-out for the return of directories!

*I've been looking for you...*
